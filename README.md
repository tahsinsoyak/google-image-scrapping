# google-image-scrapping
New scrapping method, Using selenium. I have used this project to scrape bear pictures.



> ```pip install requirements.txt```

## Usage
There are two scripts `single_image_per_query.py` and `multiple_image_per_query.py`. 

* to download single image per query use `single_image_per_query.py`
* to download all the images or more than one image per query use `multiple_image_per_query.py`.
